                        It is extraordinarily difficult to succeed in financial machine learning. That’s why we started <a href="https://predictnow.ai/" class="underline">PredictNow.ai</a>, 
                        <b>a financial machine learning SaaS</b> that computes the <b>Probability of Profit</b> for your next investment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We highlight some of the difficulties of financial ML below. and how <a href="https://predictnow.ai/" class="underline">PredictNow.ai</a> can help your investment management practice overcome them.

                    <h2>Financial data scrubbing </h2>

                    <p>
                        This may seem like a task for plumbers, but is actually the crucial first step in successful financial machine learning, and it takes surprisingly 
                        deep domain knowledge to accomplish. For example, do you know that many fundamental stocks databases have look-ahead bias? How would you find out 
                        if your news sentiment data is sensible? With years of financial and data science experience behind us, we can help you find out.

                    <p>

                    <h2>Predicting “non-reflexive”* targets</h2>

                    <p>
                        If returns can be predicted, returns will change in response to the prediction. On the other hand,
                         if weather can be predicted, weather will not change in response. Yet accurate weather prediction
                          can benefit agricultural futures traders.
                    </p>

                        <a href="https://predictnow.ai/" class="underline">PredictNow.ai</a> can help identify and predict non-reflexive targets (e.g. earnings, same-store sales, etc.) that cannot be arbitraged away.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        * Reflexivity is a term used by George Soros to describe the effects of arbitrage activities on the financial markets and the general economy. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Capital allocation and risk management via “meta-labelling”*</h2>
                    <p>
                        Determine probability of profit for a trade through machine learning models, and allocate capital and manage risks accordingly.
                         These are part of “<b>quantamental strategies</b>“: applying machine learning to help discretionary or fundamental investment managers
                          quantify and systematize their ideas, factors, and knowledge, done without the necessity of disclosing the fundamental strategy
                           to the consultant.
