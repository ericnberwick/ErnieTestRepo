                         fundamentals remain unchanged and have clearly stood the test of time since the first edition. If you want to be a competitive swimmer, you need to
                          learn the fundamentals of swimming first. Trading is no different; Ernie makes the fundamentals as simple as possible, but no simpler (as Einstein would say)
                           and strikes the perfect balance between intuition and technical depth. Those specifically interested in trading, and anyone generically interested in

                         is an in-depth study of two types of strategies: mean reverting and momentum.
                         It delves into the reasons certain markets display either mean reversion or momentum, and describes the common techniques that can exploit these profit 
                         opportunities. Numerous strategy examples are drawn from stocks, ETFs, futures, and currencies.

                        in the space is the emphasis on real examples as opposed to just theory. Concepts are not only described, they are brought to life with actual
                         trading strategies, which give the reader insight into how and why each strategy was developed, how it was implemented, and even how it was coded.
